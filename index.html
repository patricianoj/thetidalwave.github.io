				<h4 class="title">Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s Closet</h4>
				<p class = "byline"> <strong>By: Some Journalist</strong> | January 2016 | Richmond, CA</p>
				<hr>
				<img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/12647560_10102616790362931_3270313262875234676_n.jpg?oh=50df570da376c068a428731c87f2e672&oe=573C7A55" height="300px"/>
				<br/>
				<p><i>What are you wearing?</i></p>
				<p>That&rsquo;s a question that&rsquo;s tossed at chic celebrities strolling the red carpet. It&rsquo;s also a question Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will never get. After all, his wardrobe is 50 shades of gray, minus 49 of them.</p>
				<p>Day in and day out Zuckerberg dresses in the same gray T-shirt. Unseasonable weather might trigger Zuckerberg to grab a gray hoodie. On the rarest of occasions - such as a White House visit - Zuckerberg has been seen in a suit. (Surprisingly, it&rsquo;s not gray.) </p>
				<p>Monday Zuckerberg gave everyone a peek into his closet, as he marked his return from paternity leave. &quot;What should I wear?&quot; he joked.</p>
				<p>The photo featured nine identical gray T-shirts, and seven gray hoodies. The T-shirts hang in a neat line. It&rsquo;s the stately presentation most of us reserve for our more formal clothes. </p>
				<p>Zuckerberg has previously explained his dull get-ups. He&rsquo;s wary of taking on too many decisions, and directing his energy away from his work on Facebook. </p>
				<p>&quot;I feel like I&rsquo;m not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life,&quot; Zuckerberg explained in 2014.</p>
				<p>While Zuckerberg has said he only works 50 to 60 hours a week, he&rsquo;s clearly obsessed with Facebook&rsquo;s mission to connect the world.</p>
				<p>&quot;If you count all the time I&rsquo;m focused on our mission, that&rsquo;s basically my whole life,&quot; he once said. </p>
				<p>Zuckerberg isn&rsquo;t the only person to bring an extreme approach to their wardrobe. A middle-aged Steve Jobs made light jeans and black turtlenecks his uniform. The approach worked well for Jobs, who rebuilt Apple and churned out the iPod, iPhone and iPad. </p>
				<p>The strategy worked for them, which raises the question - why aren&rsquo;t more of us trying this?</p>
